      <t>An encrypted DNS server is authenticated by a certificate signed by a
      Certificate Authority (CA). However, for typical encrypted DNS server
      deployments on Customer Premise Equipment (CPEs), the signature cannot
      be obtained or it is difficult for the operator of the CPE to scale.</t>

      <t>This document explores the use of TLS delegated credentials for a DNS
      server deployed on a CPE. This approach is meant to ease operating DNS
      forwarders in CPEs while allowing to make use of encrypted DNS
      capabilities.</t>

        <t>Customer Premises Equipment (CPEs, also called Home Routers) are a
        critical component of the home network, and their security is
        essential to protecting the devices and data that are connected to
        them. For example, the prpl Foundation <xref target="prpl"></xref> has
        developed a number of initiatives to promote home router security and
        hardening. The prplWrt project <xref target="prplwrt"></xref> is an
        initiative in prpl Foundation that aims to improve the security and
        performance of open-source router firmware, such as OpenWrt <xref
        target="openwrt"></xref>. OpenWrt is an open-source operating system
        that is designed to run on a wide range of routers and embedded
        devices. It now includes support for containerization technology such
        as Docker, making it possible to run containerized applications on a
        home router. Further, DNS providers have optimized the encrypted DNS
        forwarder to run in a container in home routers.</t>

        <t>For all the cases shown in <xref target="proxied"></xref>, the CPE
        advertises itself as the default DNS server to the hosts it serves in
        the LAN. The CPE relies upon DHCP or RA to advertise itself to
        internal hosts as the default encrypted DNS forwarder. When receiving
        a DNS request it cannot handle locally, the CPE forwards the request
        to an upstream encrypted DNS. The upstream encrypted DNS can be hosted
        by the ISP or provided by a third party.</t>

        <t>Such a forwarder presence is required for IPv4 service continuity
        purposes (e.g., Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC8585"></xref>) or for
        supporting advanced services within a local network (e.g., malware
        filtering, parental control, Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD)
        <xref target="RFC8520"></xref> to only allow intended communications
        to and from an IoT device). When the CPE behaves as a DNS forwarder,
        DNS communications can be decomposed into two legs to resolve
        queries:<list style="symbols">

        <t>This section discusses some deployment challenges to host an
        encrypted DNS forwarder within a local network.</t>

        <section anchor="comp"
                 title="DDR/DNR Comparison and Naming Constraints">
          <t>DDR requires proving possession of an IP address, as the DDR
          certificate contains the server's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and is
          signed by a certificate authority. DDR is constrained to public IP
          addresses because (WebPKI) certificate authorities will not sign
          special-purpose IP addresses <xref target="RFC6890"></xref>, most
          notably IPv4 private-use <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>, IPv4 shared
          address <xref target="RFC6598"></xref>, or IPv6 <xref
          target="RFC8190">Unique-Local</xref> address space. A tempting
          solution is to use the CPE's WAN IP address for DDR and prove
          possession of that IP address. However, the CPE's WAN IPv4 address
          will not be a public IPv4 address if the CPE is behind another layer
          of NAT (either Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) or another on-premise NAT),
          reducing the success of this mechanism to CPE's WAN IPv6 address. If
          the ISP renumbers the subscriber's network suddenly (rather than
          slow IPv6 renumbering described in <xref target="RFC4192"></xref>)
          encrypted DNS service will be delayed until that new certificate is
          acquired.</t>

          <t>DNR requires proving possession of an FQDN as the encrypted
          resolver's certificate contains the FQDN. The entity (e.g., ISP,
          network administrator) managing the CPE would assign a unique FQDN
          to the CPE. There are two mechanisms for the CPE to obtain the
          certificate for the FQDN: using one of its WAN IP addresses or
          requesting its signed certificate from an Internet-facing server
          used for remote CPE management (e.g., the Auto Configuration Server
          (ACS) in the CPE WAN Management Protocol <xref
          target="TR-069"></xref>). If using a CPE's WAN IP address, the CPE
          needs a public IPv4 or a global unicast IPv6 address together with
          DNS A or AAAA records pointing to that CPE's WAN address to prove
          possession of the DNS name to obtain a WebPKI CA-signed certificate
          (that is, the CPE fulfills the DNS or HTTP challenge discussed in
          ACME <xref target="RFC8555"></xref>). However, a CPE's WAN address
          will not be a public IPv4 address if the CPE is behind another layer
          of NAT (either a CGN or another on-premise NAT), reducing the
          success of this mechanism to a CPE's WAN IPv6 address. If the
          subscribers IPv4 or IPv6 address is included in the certificate name
          (e.g., "dyn-192-0-2-1.example.net") then DNR will experience IP
          renumbering complications identical to DDR, described above. The
          former mechanism has the following limitations when ACME protocol is
          used for certificate issuance:<list style="symbols">
              <t>Each CPE would have to create a different account for
              ordering a certificate. When a large scale of CPEs (e.g.,
              millions of devices) request certificate issuance for a large
              number of subdomains, it could be treated as an attacker by the
              certificate authorities to overwhelm it.</t>

              <t>The CPE would have to host an Internet-facing HTTP server or
              a DNS authoritative server to complete the HTTP or DNS
              challenge.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="forwarder_m" title="Delegated Certificate Issuance">
          <t>The encrypted DNS forwarder is hosted on a CPE and provisioned by
          a service (e.g., ACS) in the operator's network. Each CPE has a
          unique FQDN (e.g., "cpe-12345.example.com" where 12345 might be the
          customer number or part of the device's serial number). It is
          important that the FQDN is unique for each subscriber. The CPE
          generates a public and private key-pair, builds a certificate
          signing request (CSR), and sends the CSR to a service in the vendor
          managing the CPE. Upoon receipt of the CSR, the operator's service
          can utilize Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
          <xref target="RFC8555"></xref> to automate certificate management
          functions such as domain validation procedure, certificate issuance,
          and certificate revocation.</t>

          <t>The challenge with this technique is the service will have to
          communicate with the CA to issue certificates for millions of CPEs.
          If an external CA is unable to issue a certificate in time or
          replace an expired certificate, the service would no longer be able
          to present a valid certificate to a CPE. When the service requests
          certificate issuance for a large number of subdomains (e.g.,
          millions of CPEs), it may be treated as an attacker by the CA to
          overwhelm it. Furthermore, the short-lived certificates (e.g.,
          certificates that expire after 90 days) issued by the CA will have
          to be renewed frequently. With short-lived certificates, there is a
          smaller time window to renew a certificate and, therefore, a higher
          risk that a CA outage will negatively affect the uptime of the
          encrypted DNS forwarders on CPEs (and the services offered via these
          CPEs).</t>

    <section anchor="delegated" title="Delegated Credentials">
      <t>To reduce the dependency on external CAs, this document strongly
      recommends the use of delegation credentials <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts"></xref> to be added to the TLS profile of
      encrypted DNS client and server implementations. </t>

      <t>A delegated credential (DC) is a digitally signed data structure with
      two semantic fields: a validity interval and a public key (along with
      its associated signature algorithm). The signature on the delegated
      credential indicates a delegation from the certificate that is issued to
      the peer. The private key used to sign a credential corresponds to the
      public key of the peer's X.509 end-entity certificate <xref
      target="RFC5280"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The delegation allows a service in the operator managing the CPE to
      issue its own credentials within the scope of a certificate issued by an
      external CA. These credentials only enable the CPE who is recipient of
      the delegation to terminate connections for names that the CA has
      authorized. Furthermore, this mechanism allows the encrypted DNS
      forwarder on a CPE to use modern signature algorithms, such as Ed25519
      <xref target="RFC8032"></xref> even if the CA does not support them.</t>

      <t>The signature on the delegated credential indicates a delegation from
      the certificate that is issued to a service in an infrastrcture owned by
      the CPE's operator. The private key used to sign a credential
      corresponds to the public key of the service's X.509 end-entity
      certificate <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>. The delegated credential is
      cryptographically bound to the service's X.509 end-entity certificate
      with which the credential will be used.</t>

      <t>In order to also cover DNS clients that do not support delegation
      credentials or TLS 1.3 or later, server-side mechanisms that do not
      require changes to the client behavior are required (e.g., a PKCS#11
      interface or a remote signing mechanism, <xref target="KEYLESS"></xref>
      being examples) as discussed in Section 3.2 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts"></xref>. </t>

      <t>As depicted in <xref target="poex2"></xref>, a DNS forwarder may use
      delegated credentials for DNS clients that support them, while using a
      server-side mechanism to service local legacy DNS clients.</t>

      <t>DNR-related security considerations are discussed in <xref
      section="7" target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref>. Likewise, DDR-related
      security considerations are discussed in <xref section="7"
      target="I-D.ietf-add-ddr"></xref>. The security considerations in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts"></xref> are to be taken into account.</t>

      <t>Delegated credentials allow a CPE to terminate (D)TLS connections on
      behalf of the service exposed by the operator that manages the CPE. If a
      delegated credential is stolen, there is no mechanism for revoking it
      without revoking the certificate itself. To limit exposure in case of
      the compromise of a delegated credential's private key, delegated
      credentials must not have long validity periods, whith a RECOMMENDED
      maximum validity period of 7 days.</t>

      <t>The CPE's operator may leverage the Remote Integrity Verification
      (RIV) mechanism discussed in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rats-tpm-based-network-device-attest"></xref> to verify
      that a given CPE installed at the customer's premises is authentic and
      has been configured with authorized software. If evidence reveals known
      bad or unknown software configurations on a CPE, that CPE won't be
      issued delegated credentials.</t>
