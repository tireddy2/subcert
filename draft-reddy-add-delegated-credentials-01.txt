     Delegated Credentials to Host Encrypted DNS Forwarders on CPEs
                draft-reddy-add-delegated-credentials-01

Abstract

   An encrypted DNS server is authenticated by a certificate signed by a
   Certificate Authority (CA).  However, for typical encrypted DNS
   server deployments on Customer Premise Equipment (CPEs), the
   signature cannot be obtained or requires excessive interactions with
   a Certificate Authority.

   This document explores the use of TLS delegated credentials for a DNS
   server deployed on a CPE.  This approach is meant to ease operating
   DNS forwarders in CPEs while allowing to make use of encrypted DNS
   capabilities.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  CPEs, a Critical Componenet in Home Networks.

   Customer Premises Equipment (CPEs, also called Home Routers) are a
   critical component of the home network, and their security is
   essential to protecting the devices and data that are connected to
   them.  For example, the prpl Foundation [prpl] has developed a number
   of initiatives to promote home router security and hardening.  The
   prplWrt project [prplwrt] is an initiative in prpl Foundation that
   aims to improve the security and performance of open-source router
   firmware, such as OpenWrt [openwrt].  OpenWrt is an open-source
   operating system that is designed to run on a wide range of routers
   and embedded devices.  It now includes support for containerization
   technology such as Docker, making it possible to run containerized
   applications on a home router.  Further, DNS providers have optimized
   the encrypted DNS forwarder to run in a container in home routers.

                  Figure 1: Proxied Encrypted DNS Sessions

   For all the cases shown in Figure 1, the CPE advertises itself as the
   default DNS server to the hosts it serves in the LAN.  The CPE relies
   upon DHCP or RA to advertise itself to internal hosts as the default
   encrypted DNS forwarder.  When receiving a DNS request it cannot
   handle locally, the CPE forwards the request to an upstream encrypted
   DNS.  The upstream encrypted DNS can be hosted by the ISP or provided
   by a third party.

   Such a forwarder presence is required for IPv4 service continuity
   purposes (e.g., Section 3.1 of [RFC8585]) or for supporting advanced
   services within a local network (e.g., malware filtering, parental
   control, Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) [RFC8520] to only allow
   intended communications to and from an IoT device, and multicast DNS

   proxy service for the ".local" domain [RFC6762]).  When the CPE
   behaves as a DNS forwarder, DNS communications can be decomposed into
   two legs to resolve queries:

   *  The leg between an internal host and the CPE.

   *  The leg between the CPE and an upstream DNS resolver.

1.3.  Hosting Encrypted DNS Forwarder in Local Networks

   This section discusses some deployment challenges to host an
   encrypted DNS forwarder within a local network.

1.3.1.  DDR/DNR Comparison and Naming Constraints

   DDR requires proving possession of an IP address, as the DDR
   certificate contains the server's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and is
   signed by a certificate authority.  DDR is constrained to public IP
   addresses because (WebPKI) certificate authorities will not sign
   special-purpose IP addresses [RFC6890], most notably IPv4 private-use
   [RFC1918], IPv4 shared address [RFC6598], or IPv6 Unique-Local
   [RFC8190] address space.  A tempting solution is to use the CPE's WAN
   IP address for DDR and prove possession of that IP address.  However,
   the CPE's WAN IPv4 address will not be a public IPv4 address if the
   CPE is behind another layer of NAT (either Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) or
   another on-premise NAT), reducing the success of this mechanism to
   CPE's WAN IPv6 address.  If the ISP renumbers the subscriber's
   network suddenly (rather than slow IPv6 renumbering described in
   [RFC4192]) encrypted DNS service will be delayed until that new
   certificate is acquired.

   DNR requires proving possession of an FQDN as the encrypted
   resolver's certificate contains the FQDN.  The entity (e.g., ISP,
   network administrator) managing the CPE would assign a unique FQDN to
   the CPE.  There are two mechanisms for the CPE to obtain the
   certificate for the FQDN: using one of its WAN IP addresses or
   requesting its signed certificate from an Internet-facing server used
   for remote CPE management (e.g., the Auto Configuration Server (ACS)
   in the CPE WAN Management Protocol [TR-069]).  If using a CPE's WAN
   IP address, the CPE needs a public IPv4 or a global unicast IPv6
   address together with DNS A or AAAA records pointing to that CPE's
   WAN address to prove possession of the DNS name to obtain a WebPKI
   CA-signed certificate (that is, the CPE fulfills the DNS or HTTP
   challenge discussed in ACME [RFC8555]).  However, a CPE's WAN address
   will not be a public IPv4 address if the CPE is behind another layer
   of NAT (either a CGN or another on-premise NAT), reducing the success
   of this mechanism to a CPE's WAN IPv6 address.  The mechanisms have
   the following limitations for certificate issuance:

   *  In case of large scale of CPEs (e.g., millions of devices),
      issuing certificate request for a large number of subdomains could
      be treated as an attack by the certificate authorities to
      overwhelm it.

   *  Dependency on the CA to manage a large number of certificates.

   *  If the CPE uses one of its WAN IP addresses to obtain the
      certificate for the FQDN, the internet-facing HTTP server or a DNS
      authoritative server on the CPE to complete the HTTP or DNS
      challenge can be subjected to DDoS attacks.

1.3.2.  Delegated Certificate Issuance

   The encrypted DNS forwarder is hosted on a CPE and provisioned by a
   service (e.g., ACS) in the operator's network.  Each CPE has a unique
   FQDN (e.g., "cpe-12345.example.com" where 12345 is a unique number).
   The unique FQDN MUST NOT carry any Personally Identifiable
   Information (PII) or device identification details like the customer
   number or device's serial number.  The CPE generates a public and
   private key-pair, builds a certificate signing request (CSR), and
   sends the CSR to a service in the vendor managing the CPE.  Upoon
   receipt of the CSR, the operator's service can utilize Automatic
   Certificate Management Environment (ACME) [RFC8555] to automate
   certificate management functions such as domain validation procedure,
   certificate issuance, and certificate revocation.

   The challenge with this technique is the service will have to
   communicate with the CA to issue certificates for millions of CPEs.
   If an external CA is unable to issue a certificate in time or replace
   an expired certificate, the service would no longer be able to
   present a valid certificate to a CPE.  When the service requests
   certificate issuance for a large number of subdomains (e.g., millions
   of CPEs), it may be treated as an attacker by the CA to overwhelm it.
   Furthermore, the short-lived certificates (e.g., certificates that
   expire after 90 days) issued by the CA will have to be renewed
   frequently.  With short-lived certificates, there is a smaller time
   window to renew a certificate and, therefore, a higher risk that a CA
   outage will negatively affect the uptime of the encrypted DNS
   forwarders on CPEs (and the services offered via these CPEs).

1.4.  Objectives & Scope

   This document discusses the use of delegated credentials
   [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts] to host encrypted DNS resolvers, such as DoH
   [RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], or DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ)
   [RFC9250] in managed CPEs by reducing the dependency on Certification
   Authority (CA).  The advantage of using delegated credentials on CPEs
   is that it completely removes the dependency on the CAs to provide a
   PKI certificate for each CPE.  The entity managing the CPE (e..g,
   ISP, CPE vendor, Security Service Provider) will provision it a with
   a delegated credential and renew the delegated credential before the
   expiry.

   Scope of this document is an encrypted DNS server deployed on a
   managed CPEs.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].

   The following additional terms are used:

   DHCP:  refers to both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.

   Do53:  refers to unencrypted DNS.

   DNR:  refers to the Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers
      procedure defined in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

   DDR:  refers to the Discovery of Designated Resolvers procedure
      defined in [I-D.ietf-add-ddr].

   Encrypted DNS:  refers to a scheme where DNS exchanges are
      transported over an encrypted channel.  Examples of encrypted DNS
      are DoH [RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], and DNS-over-QUIC
      (DoQ) [RFC9250].

   Managed CPE:  refers to a CPE that is managed by an ISP or CPE vendor
      or Security Service Provider.

   Unmanaged CPE:  refers to a CPE that is not managed by an ISP or CPE
      vendor or Security Service Provider.

   Delegated credential:  The certificate issued by the operator as
      described by [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts].

3.  Delegated Credentials

   To reduce the dependency on external CAs, this document RECOMMENDS
   the use of delegation credentials [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts] to be added
   to the TLS profile of encrypted DNS client and server
   implementations.

   A delegated credential (DC) is a digitally signed data structure with
   two semantic fields: a validity interval and a public key (along with
   its associated signature algorithm).  The signature on the delegated
   credential indicates a delegation from the certificate that is issued
   to the peer.

   The delegation allows a service in the operator managing the CPE to
   issue its own credentials within the scope of a certificate issued by
   an external CA.  These credentials only enable the CPE who is
   recipient of the delegation to terminate connections for names that
   the CA has authorized.  Furthermore, this mechanism allows the
   encrypted DNS forwarder on a CPE to use modern signature algorithms,
   such as Ed25519 [RFC8032] even if the CA does not support them.

   The signature on the delegated credential indicates a delegation from
   the certificate that is issued to a service in an infrastrcture owned
   by the CPE's operator.  The private key used to sign a credential
   corresponds to the public key of the service's X.509 end-entity
   certificate [RFC5280].  The delegated credential is cryptographically
   bound to the service's X.509 end-entity certificate with which the
   credential will be used.  The X.509 end-entity certificate will have
   the KeyPurposeId set to id-kp-serverAuth for the client to identify
   that the certificate is issued for a server.

   The basic sequence of steps involved is shown in Figure 2.

   1.  The DNS client provides an extension in its ClientHello that
       indicates support for delegated credentials.

   2.  The DNS forwarder sends the Certificate message providing both
       the certificate of the service as well as the delegated
       credential.

   3.  The DNS client uses information from the certificate to verify
       the delegated credential and that the DNS forwarder is asserting
       an expected identity.

   For example, the operator managing the CPEs has a X.509 end-entity
   certificate for a domain "dnsserver.example.net" and issues each
   managed CPE managed a distinct delegated credential signed by the
   private key which orresponds to the public key of the X.509 end-
   entity certificate.  If the operator is managing a large number of

   CPEs, different X.509 end-entity certificates can be used to manage a
   group of CPEs (e.g., "dnsserver.group1.example.net",
   "dnsserver.group2.example.net" etc.).  When one of the X.509 end-
   entity certificate is revoked, only the group of CPEs associated with
   that certificate need renewed delegated credentials signed by the
   private key which corresponds to the public key of the the replaced
   certificate and it reduces the burden on the operator to sign the
   credentails for only a subset of the CPEs.

4.  Legacy DNS Clients

   In order to also cover DNS clients that do not support delegation
   credentials or TLS 1.3 or later, server-side mechanisms that do not
   require changes to the client behavior are required (e.g., a PKCS#11
   interface or a remote signing mechanism, [KEYLESS] being examples) as
   discussed in Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts].

   As depicted in Figure 3, a DNS forwarder may use delegated
   credentials for DNS clients that support them, while using a server-
   side mechanism to service local legacy DNS clients.

   +------------+     +---------------+       +---------+
   | DNS Client |     | Encrypted DNS |       | Service |
   |            |     | Forwarder-CPE |       |         |
   +------+-----+     +-------+-------+       +----+----+
          |                   |          (e.g., Managed by ISP)
          |                   |                    |
          |----ClientHello--->|                    |
          |<---ServerHello----|                    |
          |<---Certificate----|                    |

          |<---CertVerify-----|                    |

5.  Design Rationle

   Alternate solutions and limitations are discussed below:

   *  The service managing the CPEs could get a CA certificate with name
      constraints extension (Section 4.2.1.10 of [RFC5280]) and the
      service would in-turn act as an ACME server to provision end-
      entity certificates on CPEs.

      -  Con: Name constraints extension is not yet supported by CAs.

      -  Pro: Avoids changing TLS ecosystem.

Internet-Draft   Delegated Credentials for Encrypted DNS       June 2023


   *  [RFC9115] defines a profile of the Automatic Certificate
      Management Environment (ACME) protocol for generating Delegated
      certificates.  It allows the CPEs to request from the service
      managing the CPEs, acting as a profiled ACME server, a certificate
      for a delegated identity -- i.e., one belonging to the service.
      The service then uses the ACME protocol (with the extensions
      described in [RFC8739]) to request issuance of a Short-Term,
      Automatically Renewed (STAR) certificate for the same delegated
      identity.  The generated short-term certificate is automatically
      renewed by the ACME Certification Authority (CA), is periodically
      fetched by the CPEs, and is used to act as encrypted DNS
      forwarders.  The service can end the delegation at any time by
      simply instructing the CA to stop the automatic renewal and
      letting the certificate expire shortly thereafter.  Star
      certificates requires support by CAs but requires no changes to
      the deployed TLS ecosystem.

      -  Con: Star certificates require support by CAs.

      -  Con: A primary use case of Star certificates is that of a
         Content Delivery Network (CDN), the third party, terminating
         TLS sessions on behalf of a content provider (the holder of a
         domain name).  The number of star certificates required for a
         CDN use case will be very much lower than the use case
         discussed in this draft.  It is yet to be seen if CAs will
         agree to support star certificates at a scale of millions of
         CPEs.

      -  Pro: Avoids changing TLS ecosystem.

6.  Security Considerations

   DNR-related security considerations are discussed in Section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].  Likewise, DDR-related security considerations
   are discussed in Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-add-ddr].  The security
   considerations in [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts] are to be taken into
   account.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA action.
