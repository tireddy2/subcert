                draft-reddy-add-delegated-credentials-00

Abstract

   This document discusses using delegated credentials for hosting
   encrypted DNS forwarders in Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).  This
   document does not intend to provide deployment recommendations, but
   is meant to exemplify how to host encrypted DNS resolvers (e.g., DNS-
   over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, or DNS-over-QUIC) on managed CPEs by
   reducing the dependency on Certification Authority.

1.  Introduction

   Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) [I-D.ietf-add-dnr]
   specifies how a local encrypted DNS resolver can be discovered by
   connected hosts by means of DHCP [RFC2132], DHCPv6 [RFC8415], and
   IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) [RFC4861] options.  These options are
   designed to convey the following information: the DNS Authentication
   Domain Name (ADN), a list of IP addresses, and a set of service
   parameters.  The ADN is used as a reference identifier for
   authentication purposes, while the list of IP addresses designate
   where to locate the resolver without relying upon an external
   resolver.  The service parameters provide additional information to
   characterize a DNS resolver (e.g., supported encrypted DNS,
   customized DNS port number, or URI Template for DNS-over-HTTPS
   (DoH)).  Such an information is used by a DNS client for DNS resolver
   selection and session establishment.

   The current challenges of hosting encrypted resolvers on CPEs is
   discussed in Section 5.

   This document discusses using delegated credentias
   [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts] to host encrypted DNS resolvers such as DoH
   [RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], or DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ)

   [RFC9250] in managed Customer Premises Equipment (CPEs) by reducing
   the dependency on Certification Authority (CA).  The advantage of
   using delegated credentials on CPEs is that it completely removes the
   dependency on the CAs to provide an PKI certificate for each CPE.
   The entity managing the CPE (e..g, ISP, CPE vendor, Security Service
   Provider) will provision it a with a delegated credential and renew
   the delegated credential before the expiry.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].

   The following additional terms are used:

   DHCP:  refers to both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.

   Do53:  refers to unencrypted DNS.

   DNR:  refers to the Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers
      procedure defined in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

   DDR:  refers to the Discovery of Designated Resolvers procedure
      defined in [I-D.ietf-add-ddr].

      transported over an encrypted channel.  Examples of encrypted DNS
      are DoT, DoH, or DoQ.

   Encrypted DNS options:  refers to the options defined in
      [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

      vendor or Security Service Provider.

   Delegated credential:  The certificate issued by the operator.

3.  Scope

   This document is purposely scoped to exemplify how encrypted DNS
   discovery mechanisms can be enabled in typical networks by reducing
   the dependency on CA.  Home routers are a critical component of the
   home network, and their security is essential to protecting the
   devices and data that are connected to them.  For instance, the prpl
   Foundation has developed a number of initiatives to promote home
   router security and hardening.  The prpl Foundation has developed a

   number of initiatives to promote home router security and hardening.
   For example, the prplWrt project is an initiative that aims to
   improve the security and performance of open-source router firmware,
   such as OpenWrt.  OpenWrt is an open-source operating system that is
   designed to run on a wide range of routers and embedded devices.  It
   now includes support for containerization technology such as Docker,
   making it possible to run containerized applications on a home
   router.  Further, DNS providers have optimized the encrypted DNS
   forwarder to run in a container in home router.

4.  Managed CPEs

   This section focuses on managed CPEs.

4.1.  Proxied DNS

   Figure 1 shows various network setups where the CPE embeds a caching
   encrypted DNS forwarder.  Section 5.1 discusses the applicability of
   DDR as a function of the address used by the CPE for the verification
   of ownership.

   For all the cases shown in Figure 1, the CPE advertises itself as the
   default DNS server to the hosts it serves in the LAN.  The CPE relies
   upon DHCP or RA to advertise itself to internal hosts as the default
   encrypted DNS forwarder.  When receiving a DNS request it cannot
   handle locally, the CPE forwards the request to an upstream encrypted
   DNS.  The upstream encrypted DNS can be hosted by the ISP or provided
   by a third party.

   Such a forwarder presence is required for IPv4 service continuity
   purposes (e.g., Section 3.1 of [RFC8585]) or for supporting advanced
   services within a local network (e.g., malware filtering, parental
   control, Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) [RFC8520] to only allow
   intended communications to and from an IoT device).  When the CPE
   behaves as a DNS forwarder, DNS communications can be decomposed into
   two legs:

   *  The leg between an internal host and the CPE.

   *  The leg between the CPE and an upstream DNS resolver.

5.  Hosting Encrypted DNS Forwarder in Local Networks

   This section discusses some deployment challenges to host an
   encrypted DNS forwarder within a local network

5.1.  DDR/DNR Comparison and Naming Constraints

   DDR requires proving possession of an IP address, as the DDR
   certificate contains the server's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and is
   signed by a certificate authority.  DDR is constrained to public IP
   addresses because WebPKI certificate authorities will not sign
   special-purpose IP addresses [RFC6890], most notably IPv4 private-use
   [RFC1918], IPv4 shared address [RFC6598], or IPv6 Unique-Local
   [RFC8190] address space.  A tempting solution is to use the CPE's WAN
   IP address for DDR and prove possession of that IP address.  However,
   the CPE's WAN IPv4 address will not be a public IPv4 address if the
   CPE is behind another layer of NAT (either Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) or
   another on-premise NAT), reducing the success of this mechanism to
   CPE's WAN IPv6 address.  If the ISP renumbers the subscriber's
   network suddenly (rather than slow IPv6 renumbering described in
   [RFC4192]) encrypted DNS service will be delayed until that new
   certificate is acquired.

   DNR requires proving possession of an FQDN as the encrypted
   resolver's certificate contains the FQDN.  The entity (e.g., ISP,
   network administrator) managing the CPE would assign a unique FQDN to
   the CPE.  There are two mechanisms for the CPE to obtain the
   certificate for the FQDN: using one of its WAN IP addresses or



Reddy, et al.            Expires 24 August 2023                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   Delegated Credentials for encrypted DNS   February 2023


   requesting its signed certificate from an Internet-facing server used
   for remote CPE management (e.g., the Auto Configuration Server (ACS)
   in the CPE WAN Management Protocol [TR-069]).  If using a CPE's WAN
   IP address, the CPE needs a public IPv4 or a global unicast IPv6
   address together with DNS A or AAAA records pointing to that CPE's
   WAN address to prove possession of the DNS name to obtain a WebPKI
   CA-signed certificate (that is, the CPE fulfills the DNS or HTTP
   challenge discussed in ACME [RFC8555]).  However, a CPE's WAN address
   will not be a public IPv4 address if the CPE is behind another layer
   of NAT (either a CGN or another on-premise NAT), reducing the success
   of this mechanism to a CPE's WAN IPv6 address.  If the subscribers
   IPv4 or IPv6 address is included in the certificate name (e.g., "dyn-
   192-0-2-1.example.net") then DNR will experience IP renumbering
   complications identical to DDR, described above.  The former
   mechanism has the following limitations when ACME protocol is used
   for certificate issuance:

   *  Each CPE would have to create a different account for ordering a
      certificate.  When a large scale of CPEs (e.g., millions of
      devices) request certificate issuance for a large number of
      subdomains, it could be treated as an attacker by the certificate
      authorities to overwhelm it.

   *  The CPE would have to host an Internet-facing HTTP server or a DNS
      authoritative server to complete the HTTP or DNS challenge.

5.2.  Delegated certificate issuance

   The DoT/DoH forwarder is hosted on the CPE, it is provisioned by a
   service (e.g., Orchestrator) in the operator managing the CPE with a
   unique FQDN (e.g., cpe1.example.com).  The CPE generates public and
   private key-pair, builds a certificate signing request (CSR), and
   sends the CSR to a service in the vendor managing the CPE that will
   perform the ACME proof-of-control to get an ACME-signed certificate.
   Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) [RFC8555] can be
   used by the vendor managing the CPEs to automate certificate
   management functions such as domain validation procedure, certificate
   issuance, and certificate revocation.

Internet-Draft   Delegated Credentials for encrypted DNS   February 2023


   The challenge with this technique is the service will have
   communicate with the CA to issue certificates for millions of CPEs.
   If an CA is unable to issue a certificate in time or replace a
   expired certificate, the service would no longer be able to present a
   valid certificate to CPEs.  When the service requests certificate
   issuance for a large number of subdomains (i.e., millions of CPEs),
   it could be treated as an attacker by the certificate authorities to
   overwhelm it.  Further, the short-lived certificates (e.g.,
   certificates that typically expire after 90 days) issued by the CA
   will have to be renewed frequently.

   If an external CA is unable to issue a certificate in time to replace
   a deployed certificate, the service would no longer be able to
   present a valid certificate to CPE.  With short-lived certificates,
   there is a smaller window of time to renew a certificates and
   therefore a higher risk that an outage at a CA will negatively affect
   the uptime of the encrypted DNS forwarders on CPEs.

6.  Delegated Credentials

   To reduce the dependency on external CAs, this document strongly
   recommends the use of delegation credentails [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts]
   to be added to the TLS profile of encrypted DNS client and server
   implementations.  A delegated credential (DC) is a digitally signed
   data structure with two semantic fields: a validity interval and a
   public key (along with its associated signature algorithm).  The
   signature on the delegated credential indicates a delegation from the
   certificate that is issued to the peer.  The private key used to sign
   a credential corresponds to the public key of the peer's X.509 end-
   entity certificate [RFC5280].

   It allows a service in the operator managing the CPE to issue its own
   credentials within the scope of a certificate issued by an external
   CA.  These credentials only enable the CPE who is recipient of the
   delegation to terminate connections for names that the CA has
   authorized.  Furthermore, this mechanism allows the encrypted DNS
   forwarder on CPE to use modern signature algorithms such as Ed25519
   [RFC8032] even if the CA does not support them.

   The signature on the delegated credential indicates a delegation from
   the certificate that is issued to service in the operator managing
   the CPE.  The private key used to sign a credential corresponds to
   the public key of the service's X.509 end-entity certificate
   [RFC5280].  The delegated credential is cryptographically bound to
   the service's X.509 end-entity certificate with which the credential
   will be used.

             Figure 2: An Example use of delegated credentials

   In order to support DNS clients which do not support delegation
   credentails or TLS 1.3 or later, server-side mechanisms that do not
   require changes to client behavior are required (e.g., a PKCS#11
   interface or a remote signing mechanism, [KEYLESS] being one
   example).  These mechanisms, however, incur per-transaction latency,
   since the DNS Forwarder has to interact with a service that holds a
   private key.  A DNS forwarder could use delegated credentials for DNS
   clients that support them, while using a server-side mechanism to
   support legacy DNS clients.

                      Figure 4: Sequence Diagram

   1.  The DNS client provides an extension in its ClientHello that
       indicates support for delegated credentails.

   2.  The DNS forwarder sends the Certificate message providing both
       the certificate of the service as well as the delegated
       credential.

   3.  The DNS client uses information from the certificate to verify
       the delegated credential and that the DNS forwarder is asserting
       an expected identity.

7.  Security Considerations

   DNR-related security considerations are discussed in Section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].  Likewise, DDR-related security considerations
   are discussed in Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-add-ddr].  The security
   considerations in [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts] are to be taken into
   account.

Internet-Draft   Delegated Credentials for encrypted DNS   February 2023


   Delegated credentials allow a CPE to terminate (D)TLS connections on
   behalf of the service in the operator managing the CPE.  If a
   credential is stolen, there is no mechanism for revoking it without
   revoking the certificate itself.  To limit exposure in case of the
   compromise of a delegated credential's private key, delegated
   credentials must have a maximum validity period of 7 days.

   The operator of the CPE can leverage the Remote Integrity
   Verification (RIV) mechanism discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-tpm-based-network-device-attest] to verify that the
   CPE installed at the customer's site is authentic and has been
   configured with authorized software.
