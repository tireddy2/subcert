     Delegated credentials to host encrypted DNS forwarders on CPEs
                draft-reddy-add-delegated-credentials-00

Abstract

   This document discusses using delegated credentials for hosting
   encrypted DNS forwarders in Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).  This
   document does not intend to provide deployment recommendations, but
   is meant to exemplify how to host encrypted DNS resolvers (e.g., DNS-
   over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, or DNS-over-QUIC) on managed CPEs by
   reducing the dependency on Certification Authority.

1.  Introduction

   The current challenges of hosting encrypted resolvers on CPEs is
   discussed in Section 6.

      |  Could we move that entire section into the introduction?  Or is
      |  there a fear it is too long for an introduction?

   This document discusses using delegated credentias
   [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts] to host encrypted DNS resolvers such as DoH
   [RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], or DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ)
   [RFC9250] in managed Customer Premises Equipment (CPEs) by reducing
   the dependency on Certification Authority (CA).  The advantage of
   using delegated credentials on CPEs is that it completely removes the
   dependency on the CAs to provide an PKI certificate for each CPE.
   The entity managing the CPE (e..g, ISP, CPE vendor, Security Service
   Provider) will provision it a with a delegated credential and renew
   the delegated credential before the expiry.

   As discussed in Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts], mechanisms
   like [KEYLESS] can provide backwards compatibility to encrypted DNS
   clients that do not yet support this specification.  Client support
   is indicated in their TLS ClientHello.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].

   The following additional terms are used:

   DHCP:  refers to both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.

   Do53:  refers to unencrypted DNS.

   DNR:  refers to the Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers
      procedure defined in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

   DDR:  refers to the Discovery of Designated Resolvers procedure
      defined in [I-D.ietf-add-ddr].

   Encrypted DNS:  refers to a scheme where DNS exchanges are
      transported over an encrypted channel.  Examples of encrypted DNS
      are DoH [RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], and DNS-over-QUIC
      (DoQ) [RFC9250].

   Managed CPE:  refers to a CPE that is managed by an ISP or CPE vendor
      or Security Service Provider.

   Unmanaged CPE:  refers to a CPE that is not managed by an ISP or CPE
      vendor or Security Service Provider.

   Delegated credential:  The certificate issued by the operator as
      described by [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts].

3.  Scope

   Scope of this document isan ISP-managed encrypted DNS server deployed
   on customer premise equipment.

4.  prpl

      |  I can't find an obvious home for this 'prpl' discussion

   Home routers are a critical component of the home network, and their
   security is essential to protecting the devices and data that are
   connected to them.  For instance, the prpl Foundation has developed a
   number of initiatives to promote home router security and hardening.

   The prpl Foundation has developed a number of initiatives to promote
   home router security and hardening.  For example, the prplWrt project
   is an initiative that aims to improve the security and performance of
   open-source router firmware, such as OpenWrt.  OpenWrt is an open-
   source operating system that is designed to run on a wide range of
   routers and embedded devices.  It now includes support for
   containerization technology such as Docker, making it possible to run
   containerized applications on a home router.  Further, DNS providers
   have optimized the encrypted DNS forwarder to run in a container in
   home router.

5.  Deployment of Managed CPE

   This section discusses deployment models for managed CPE.

5.1.  Proxied DNS

   Figure 1 shows various network setups where the CPE embeds a caching
   encrypted DNS forwarder.  Section 6.1 discusses the applicability of
   DDR as a function of the address used by the CPE for the verification
   of ownership.

                  Figure 1: Proxied Encrypted DNS Sessions

      |  In diagram (b), the vertical line extending down from the ISP
      |  has nothing connected.  Is that intentional?  I expect the ISP
      |  and the CPE still do DNR, like in (a), but points at the
      |  3rdparty DNS resolver?  Not sure, though, so I didn't edit the
      |  diagram

   For all the cases shown in Figure 1, the CPE advertises itself as the
   default DNS server to the hosts it serves in the LAN.  The CPE relies
   upon DHCP or RA to advertise itself to internal hosts as the default
   encrypted DNS forwarder.  When receiving a DNS request it cannot
   handle locally, the CPE forwards the request to an upstream encrypted
   DNS.  The upstream encrypted DNS can be hosted by the ISP or provided
   by a third party.

   Such a forwarder presence is required for IPv4 service continuity
   purposes (e.g., Section 3.1 of [RFC8585]) or for supporting advanced
   services within a local network (e.g., malware filtering, parental
   control, Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) [RFC8520] to only allow
   intended communications to and from an IoT device).  When the CPE
   behaves as a DNS forwarder, DNS communications can be decomposed into
   two legs:

   *  The leg between an internal host and the CPE.

   *  The leg between the CPE and an upstream DNS resolver.

      |  Not sure 'service continutity' is best description of all those
      |  services, but I can't think of a better name.
      |  
      |  Does ".local" (and Bonjour and friends) also require a local
      |  CPE-provided DNS server?
      |  
      |  Overall, it seems all of these reasons to have an on-premise
      |  DNS server justify moving all of this paragraph into the
      |  Introduction?  Thoughts?

6.  Hosting Encrypted DNS Forwarder in Local Networks

   This section discusses some deployment challenges to host an
   encrypted DNS forwarder within a local network

6.1.  DDR/DNR Comparison and Naming Constraints

   DDR requires proving possession of an IP address, as the DDR
   certificate contains the server's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and is
   signed by a certificate authority.  DDR is constrained to public IP
   addresses because WebPKI certificate authorities will not sign
   special-purpose IP addresses [RFC6890], most notably IPv4 private-use
   [RFC1918], IPv4 shared address [RFC6598], or IPv6 Unique-Local
   [RFC8190] address space.  A tempting solution is to use the CPE's WAN
   IP address for DDR and prove possession of that IP address.  However,
   the CPE's WAN IPv4 address will not be a public IPv4 address if the
   CPE is behind another layer of NAT (either Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) or
   another on-premise NAT), reducing the success of this mechanism to
   CPE's WAN IPv6 address.  If the ISP renumbers the subscriber's
   network suddenly (rather than slow IPv6 renumbering described in
   [RFC4192]) encrypted DNS service will be delayed until that new
   certificate is acquired.

   DNR requires proving possession of an FQDN as the encrypted
   resolver's certificate contains the FQDN.  The entity (e.g., ISP,
   network administrator) managing the CPE would assign a unique FQDN to
   the CPE.  There are two mechanisms for the CPE to obtain the
   certificate for the FQDN: using one of its WAN IP addresses or
   requesting its signed certificate from an Internet-facing server used
   for remote CPE management (e.g., the Auto Configuration Server (ACS)
   in the CPE WAN Management Protocol [TR-069]).  If using a CPE's WAN
   IP address, the CPE needs a public IPv4 or a global unicast IPv6
   address together with DNS A or AAAA records pointing to that CPE's
   WAN address to prove possession of the DNS name to obtain a WebPKI
   CA-signed certificate (that is, the CPE fulfills the DNS or HTTP
   challenge discussed in ACME [RFC8555]).  However, a CPE's WAN address
   will not be a public IPv4 address if the CPE is behind another layer
   of NAT (either a CGN or another on-premise NAT), reducing the success
   of this mechanism to a CPE's WAN IPv6 address.  If the subscribers
   IPv4 or IPv6 address is included in the certificate name (e.g., "dyn-
   192-0-2-1.example.net") then DNR will experience IP renumbering
   complications identical to DDR, described above.

      |  I moved this out of Introduction, as it was just sort of
      |  hanging there.  Keeping it for safety, and it seems sort of a
      |  useful introductory-level summary.  But felt out of place to
      |  solel discuss DNR in the introduction without an explanation
      |  why.  So I'm leaving it here in case someone has a better idea
      |  for where to place this paragraph
      |  
      |  Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR)
      |  [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] specifies how a local encrypted DNS resolver
      |  can be discovered by connected hosts by means of DHCP

      |  [RFC2132], DHCPv6 [RFC8415], and IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)
      |  [RFC4861] options.  These options are designed to convey the
      |  following information: the DNS Authentication Domain Name
      |  (ADN), a list of IP addresses, and a set of service parameters.
      |  The ADN is used as a reference identifier for authentication
      |  purposes, while the list of IP addresses designate where to
      |  locate the resolver without relying upon an external resolver.
      |  The service parameters provide additional information to
      |  characterize a DNS resolver (e.g., supported encrypted DNS,
      |  customized DNS port number, or URI Template for DNS-over-HTTPS
      |  (DoH)).  Such an information is used by a DNS client for DNS
      |  resolver selection and session establishment.

6.2.  Problems with Obtaining CA-Signed Certificates

      |  This section still has some redundancies that can be cleaned
      |  up.

   The DoT/DoH forwarder is hosted on the CPE and provisioned by a
   service (e.g., Orchestrator) in the operator's network.  Each CPE has
   a unique FQDN (e.g., cpe-12345.example.com where 12345 might be the
   customer number or part of the device's serial number).  It is
   important that the FQDN is unique for each subscriber.  The CPE
   generates a public and private key-pair, builds a certificate signing
   request (CSR), and sends the CSR to a service in the vendor managing
   the CPE.  On receipt of the CSR, the ISP's service can utilize
   Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) [RFC8555] to
   automate certificate management functions such as domain validation
   procedure, certificate issuance, and certificate revocation.

   The challenge with this technique is the service will have to
   communicate with the CA to issue certificates for millions of CPEs.
   If an CA is unable to issue a certificate in time or replace a
   expired certificate, the service would no longer be able to present a
   valid certificate to CPEs.  When the service requests certificate
   issuance for a large number of subdomains (i.e., millions of CPEs),
   it could be treated as an attacker by the certificate authorities to
   overwhelm it.  Further, the short-lived certificates (e.g.,
   certificates that typically expire after 90 days) issued by the CA
   will have to be renewed frequently.

   If an external CA is unable to issue a certificate in time to replace
   a deployed certificate, the service would no longer be able to
   present a valid certificate to CPE.  With short-lived certificates,
   there is a smaller window of time to renew a certificates and
   therefore a higher risk that an outage at a CA will negatively affect
   the uptime of the encrypted DNS forwarders on CPEs.

Internet-Draft   Delegated Credentials for encrypted DNS   February 2023


   The former mechanism has the following limitations when ACME protocol
   is used for certificate issuance:

   *  Each CPE would have to create a different account for ordering a
      certificate.  When a large scale of CPEs (e.g., millions of
      devices) request certificate issuance for a large number of
      subdomains, it could be treated as an attacker by the certificate
      authorities to overwhelm it.

   *  The CPE would have to host an Internet-facing HTTP server or a DNS
      authoritative server to complete the HTTP or DNS challenge.

7.  Delegated Credentials

   To reduce the dependency on external CAs, this document strongly
   recommends the use of delegation credentails [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts]
   to be added to the TLS profile of encrypted DNS client and server
   implementations.  A delegated credential (DC) is a digitally signed
   data structure with two semantic fields: a validity interval and a
   public key (along with its associated signature algorithm).  The
   signature on the delegated credential indicates a delegation from the
   certificate that is issued to the peer.  The private key used to sign
   a credential corresponds to the public key of the peer's X.509 end-
   entity certificate [RFC5280].

   It allows a service in the operator managing the CPE to issue its own
   credentials within the scope of a certificate issued by an external
   CA.  These credentials only enable the CPE who is recipient of the
   delegation to terminate connections for names that the CA has
   authorized.  Furthermore, this mechanism allows the encrypted DNS
   forwarder on CPE to use modern signature algorithms such as Ed25519
   [RFC8032] even if the CA does not support them.

   The signature on the delegated credential indicates a delegation from
   the certificate that is issued to service in the operator managing
   the CPE.  The private key used to sign a credential corresponds to
   the public key of the service's X.509 end-entity certificate
   [RFC5280].  The delegated credential is cryptographically bound to
   the service's X.509 end-entity certificate with which the credential
   will be used.

   1.  The DNS client provides an extension in its ClientHello that
       indicates support for delegated credentails.

   2.  The DNS forwarder sends the Certificate message providing both
       the certificate of the service as well as the delegated
       credential.

   3.  The DNS client uses information from the certificate to verify
       the delegated credential and that the DNS forwarder is asserting
       an expected identity.

8.  Security Considerations

   DNR-related security considerations are discussed in Section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].  Likewise, DDR-related security considerations
   are discussed in Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-add-ddr].  The security
   considerations in [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts] are to be taken into
   account.

   Delegated credentials allow a CPE to terminate (D)TLS connections on
   behalf of the service in the operator managing the CPE.  If a
   credential is stolen, there is no mechanism for revoking it without
   revoking the certificate itself.  To limit exposure in case of the
   compromise of a delegated credential's private key, delegated
   credentials must have a maximum validity period of 7 days.

      |  The above paragraph is confusing to Dan.  When it says 'a
      |  credential is stolen', it needs more precision: it is referring
      |  to a private key?  And which entity's private key, specifically
      |  -- to the CPE's private key or to the CA's private key?  That
      |  is, if "Alice" has her private key compromised, does that have
      |  any impact to "Bob"?  Seems not.  If the ISP's private key
      |  associated with subcert is stolen, that seems to require a new
      |  certificate and new subcert for all users -- and the 7 day
      |  rotation has no bearing on such a situation.
      |  
      |  Seems we also need "Unique FQDNs are required, otherwise ___"?
      |  
      |  If there is another user "Carol", what benefit of "limited
      |  exposure" does Carol achieve if Carol's delegated credentials,
      |  on her CPE, are only 7 days?  I mean, whatever caused the theft
      |  of her private key may well persist and occur again when Carol
      |  gets a new certificate, right?  Seems worth discussing that, as
      |  well, as refreshing Carol's subcert only helps with a one-off
      |  theft of Carol's private key

   The operator of the CPE can leverage the Remote Integrity
   Verification (RIV) mechanism discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-tpm-based-network-device-attest] to verify that the
   CPE installed at the customer's site is authentic and has been
   configured with authorized software.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA action.
